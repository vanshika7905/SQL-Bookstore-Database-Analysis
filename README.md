This repository contains a Bookstore Database project where I worked with Books, Customers, and Orders tables and wrote 20 SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.

🗂️ Tables

🔸Books – Contains details of all books (title, author, genre, price, stock, published year).
🔸Customers – Contains customer information (name, country, city).
🔸Orders – Contains order details (customer, book, quantity, total amount, order date).

💻 SQL Queries

The project includes queries to perform various tasks such as:

🔸Retrieve books by genre (e.g., Fiction, Fantasy)
🔸Find books published after a certain year
🔸List customers from specific countries
🔸Show orders placed in a particular month
🔸Calculate total book stock and revenue
🔸Identify most expensive/least stocked books
🔸Analyze books sold per genre and by author
🔸Find most frequent orders and top customers
🔸Calculate remaining stock after orders

(Total 20 queries included, covering key data retrieval and analysis tasks.)
